## Market Opportunity

### The Global Land Ownership Crisis


With 5 billion people lacking formal land records, Landano is positioned as a first-mover solution in an underserved $1+ trillion global market. The platform is gaining traction in Ghana and Mozambique, with over 24,000 land records already uploaded to the Cardano testnet and partnerships covering over 5 million people.
  
- 1 billion people live under daily risk of land loss due to outdated or corrupt systems.  
- High costs and inefficiency plague traditional land registries, hindering secure transactions.

### Why Africa First?

- 121 million people in sub-Saharan Africa fear losing their land within five years.  
- No major blockchain competitors focusing on land title digitization for customary landowners.  
- Africa’s successful leapfrogging of technology adoption (e.g., mobile banking) provides a scalable entry model.  
- Customary governance structures allow a bureaucracy-free expansion strategy.

## Competitive Advantage

Unlike other blockchain-based property platforms, Landano has no direct competitors in its target markets. Other platforms, such as **Propy**, **Seso Global**, and **Re-Twin** focus on urban real estate markets rather than customary land ownership in emerging economies.

**Landano’s unique advantages include:**

- Bureaucracy-free onboarding via partnerships with local customary leaders.  
- Fraud-proof, blockchain-backed transactions ensuring land security.  
- Scalable, multi-revenue model with transaction fees, SaaS subscriptions, and DeFi lending.  
- Global expansion potential beyond Africa into similar emerging markets.
